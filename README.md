 Smart Airport Security Checkpoint System using Logic Circuits

Core Concept:
Design a logic circuit-based system for priority check-in and baggage scanning that integrates multiplexers, object counters, and parity checkers to manage travelers more efficiently at an airport security gate.


 What It Will Do:

1. Person Priority Checker (Multiplexer-based):
Assigns high/low priority to passengers (e.g., VIP, business class, regular) using selection lines of multiplexers.


2. Object Counter:
Counts how many people pass through a checkpoint using sensors (simulate with switches).


3. Parity Checker (Hamming Code):
Performs a simple parity check on scanned baggage data (simulate with binary input) to detect transmission errors.


4. Traffic Light Controller:
Controls gate passage:

Green: proceed

Red: wait / recheck

Yellow: caution / processing



5. Random ID Generator:
Generates a pseudo-random security code or token using flip-flops and LFSRs.



 Logic Components Youâ€™ll Use:

Multiplexers (MUX)

Counters (Synchronous/Asynchronous)

Parity Checkers (Hamming/Even-Odd logic)

Flip-flops (for state storage and random ID generation)

Finite State Machines (FSMs for traffic control and person flow)

Clock generator for sequential control

Basic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc)
